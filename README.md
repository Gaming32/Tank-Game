# Tank Game

This is my week 15 assignment for AP Computer Science Principles.

To play the game you need Python 3.9 or later installed, and you must install (with upgrades!) the packages in requirements.txt.
Then run main.py in the root directory of this repo.

```shell
python3.9 -m pip install -Ur requirements.txt
python3.9 main.py
```
