# Tank Game

This is my week 15 assignment for AP Computer Science Principles.

## Running the game

To play the game you need Python 3.9 or later installed, and you must install (with upgrades!) the packages in requirements.txt.
Then run main.py in the root directory of this repo.

```shell
python3.9 -m pip install -Ur requirements.txt
python3.9 main.py
```

## Playing the game

Your goal is to destroy as many enemy tanks as you can before getting destroyed yourself.

The controls are fairly simple: aim the turret with your mouse, and shoot with left click. To move, use the WASD keys.

+ W will move the tank forward
+ S will move the tank backward
+ A will turn the tank to the left
+ D will turn the tank to the right

Pressing F3 will open the debug screen
